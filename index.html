								<p>My interest in STEM dates back to as far as I can remember. Whether it would be solving math problems with my dad on the way to school or researching information online, I was constantly surrounded by science, engineering, and math. I later realized where my real passion lies: I love solving and optimizing problems. Therefore, Computer Science was a natural career choice. I am extremely interested in the field of machine learning, especially when applied to the realm of biology. If you would like to view my experience, <a href="#work">click here</a>.</p>

								<h4>Ultimate Software Group</h4>
								<blockquote>Won a company-wide hackathon that result in the project being converted into a customer-facing product in the company. The project was presented to the CTO and several other executives. As part of the process to convert the project into a product, I've developed an algorithm that converts natural language into SQL using natural language processing techniques. I am currently acting as a tech lead for this team.</blockquote>
								<h4>FutureAdvisor</h4>
								<blockquote>Solely created a dev tool that analyzes a Jenkins CI run (on their algorithm) and renders a dashboard that displays all the data in a visually pleasing format. The dashboard also allows you to compare two CI runs, in the case where you must compare your test branch with your master branch. Prior to the dashboard, testing the algorithm was an error-prone process. At the end of my internship, I presented the dashboard at an "all hands" meeting and the CEO and CTO praised it. As I was working on the dashboard, I also handled software releases using Git and Jenkins.</blockquote>
                                <h4>Computer Science Tutoring</h4>
								<blockquote>I was a College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) certified tutor for over 60% of the core Computer Science courses at Florida Atlantic University. I met with students at least 8hrs/week to review assignments and concepts. I have received an award for having the most recurring students.</blockquote>
                                <h4>Research, 3D Bioprinting</h4>
								<blockquote>I was the primary software engineer of a research group that studies 3D printers and how they can be used to create organs and bones to aid individuals in need of a transplant. This role requires skills in computer science, chemistry, and biology. </blockquote>
                                <h4>A Graduation Planner, Senior Design Project</h4>
								<blockquote>Along with my team, I created a "graduation planner" that essentially analyzes the courses the user has taken, how many classes they want to take, etc and outputs for them a sample schedule for their next semester. The purpose of this application is to automate that portion of advising. Whenever a new course schedule is available, advising is flooded with requests to help students pick out a schedule for next semester. For this project, I was the team lead (Product Owner) and followed the agile development process. I also developed the algorithm for the planner by myself. The project was praised by my professor.</blockquote>

                                <p>I am currently attending my first year of graduate school in the MSCS program at NYU's Courant Institute. I am focused on taking classes in the fields of Machine Learning and Computational Biology, as those are the fields that interest me most. I graduated in May 2017 with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, Magna Cum Laude (a short 0.03 GPA points away from Summa Cum Laude)!</p>
